The spot welder is made of two boards which are stacked on top of each other.
One board contains all the logic and low power electronic components and the other one contains the Mosfets.

The gerber files are made to be used at pcbway.com

There are two versions of the gerber files available.

1.
Uncomplicated method. (recommended if you dont want to chat with pcbway support)
You can use the Arduino_Board_Gerber.zip and the Mosfet_Board_Gerber.zip . So you have one gerber file for each board.

2.
You can use the Spot_welder_v2_gerber.zip which has both boards combined to one big board. 
You have to cut this in half at home to get the two single boards.
In the last time pcb way caused some problems when ordering this combinde board, depending on who of theire employes checks the gerber file.
Tell pcb way that they should make it as one board and not as panelized boards or v-cut or something.



To download Zip files click on them and then click "view raw". 
Downloading by right click and "save as" does seem to cause problems.
